It is important to never “lock” the knees out, and instead keep them “soft” but strong.</li><li>Grip: the three grip options for a barbell deadlift are double overhand (palms down, or pronated), mixed grip (one hand palm up/supinated, one hand palm down/pronated), or hook grip.Trap bar deadlift variations employ a neutral grip, with the palms facing each other. Regardless of grip choice, the goal is to set the bar in the first “crease” of the fingers. This is where we are strongest in holding or pulling movements. Attempting to bury the bar deep in the palm will cause the bar to roll and move, decreasing strength and increasing the risk of blisters or a torn callus. Double overhand is recommended for beginners and non-barbell variations.  Mixed grip is stronger than double overhand, however prolonged use can lead to muscular and structural imbalances in the upper back, shoulders, and spine. Hook grip is the strongest grip to use, but can be painful at first and is considered a more advanced grip variation</li><li>Neutral spine: coaches often use the terms “flat back” or “table top back” to describe spinal positioning.

It is very important to maintain a neutral spine throughout the entire hinge movement to help reduce risk of injury and improve performance.</li><li>Glute lockout: rather than finishing a deadlift by throwing the shoulders back and hyperextending (arching) through the low back, the goal is instead to “tuck” the glutes directly under the shoulders in a neutral posture to complete the lockout. This movement is known as a “posterior pelvic tilt”, and is extremely important for health and function of the lumbar spine and pelvis.</li></ul><p>Not sure how high or low your hips need to be at the start? Ideally the shins are vertical (or as close as you can get, depending on limb lengths), with the shoulders directly over the bar. This can mean slightly different hip heights depending on the person.

This should be your ideal starting position, with your hips at the correct height. This will also guarantee that the bar remains close to the legs over the entire range of motion. The closer the bar remains to the body’s center of mass, the more weight that can be lifted safely.</p>';
Description_Dict["Hinge"][10] = '<p>In a SNATCH GRIP RDL, the hands are placed much wider than shoulder width apart. Snatch grip refers to the grip used in the snatch, one of the Olympic weightlifting movements. For an ideal snatch grip width, the bar is placed directly at the hip crease when standing upright. If you hinge slightly and the bar does not begin to slide down the thighs, this is the correct placement. See the <b>BB RDL</b> description for other coaching cues.</p>';

Description_Dict["Squat"][1] = '<p>The squat movement pattern is one of the most important to develop lower body strength. A common beginning variation of the squat pattern is a Goblet Squat to Box. The exercise begins in a standing position, with a dumbbell resting in the palms directly in front of the sternum. The lifter descends, squatting to a box with good technique and a neutral spine, briefly touches the box, and returns to a standing position. The primary muscles groups involved include the gluteals, hamstrings, quadriceps, and the muscles of the trunk and core.</p><ul><li>Stance: the stance typically used for a squat is a “strength stance”, or approximately shoulder width apart. Exact stance width varies due to limb length and pelvic anthropometric differences. While some people prefer to squat with the toes facing forward (neutral), Alloy Strength recommends angling the feet out approximately 15 degrees. This “toes out” position aids in proper knee tracking and improves gluteal activation due to the external rotation at the hip. It is important to never “lock” the knees out, and instead keep them “soft” but strong.</li><li>An ideal “goblet” position involves the dumbbell or kettlebell resting in the palms, under the chin and in front of the sternum, with the elbows pulled in towards the dumbbell and the shoulder blades retracted (pinched back).</li><li>Hips engage first: Even though the greatest range of motion in a squat is observed at the knee, a proper squat pattern still begins with a slight hinge movement. This engages the musculature of the hip, especially the gluteals, and aids in proper knee tracking, weight distribution, and bar path.</li><li>Knee tracking: one of the most common and dangerous dysfunctions in a squat pattern is for the knees to collapse in towards one another. This is known as “valgus”, and places a great deal of stress on the supportive structures of the knee, particularly the meniscus and ACL, greatly increasing the risk of injury. Ideally, the knees track over the little, or pinky, toes at all times. This is a safe and strong position for the feet, knees, and hips.</li><li>Maintain neutral spine: Neutral spine: coaches often use the terms “flat back” or “table top back” to describe spinal positioning.

Description_Dict["Squat"][2] = '<p>In a BOX SQUAT the lifter’s entire body weight slowly comes to complete rest on the platform. It is important to maintain tension and a neutral spine. A common error in a box squat is “rocking back” too far onto the box, changing torso angle to become too upright. This causes a loss of glute activation and excessive extension or flexion through the lumbar spine.  A good rule of thumb for box height is for the hip joint to be slightly above the knee joint when the lifter is on the box.

Parallel depth is only required in the sport of powerlifting to judge a good lift. While ideally everyone would be able to squat below parallel, this is not always the case, especially at first.

Unfortunately the term core has become synonymous with the rectus abdominis, or “6 pack” muscle, when there are many more muscle groups and structures involved in the core. The pillar refers to the shoulders, spine, and pelvis, and any muscle group that attaches to these bony structures. The goal of a strong, rigid pillar is to resist movement and maintain a neutral posture while efficiently transferring force produced by the limbs. The deadbug is a great place to begin with pillar or core training (or what Alloy Strength refers to as “anterior chain” exercises) because it involves every structure of the pillar, as well as both functions of the pillar. Mastering the deadbug can have tremendous carryover to strength, performance, and overall health.</p><p>A typical error in the deadbug is to lose proper bracing of the abdominal wall and low back, which causes the movement of the hips to be initiated by the hip flexors instead of the core musculature and leads to an extended low back position that loses contact with the floor. Think instead about drawing your hips towards your shoulders to maintain a neutral spine, and keeping the lower abdominal muscles activated as the leg lowers towards the ground.</p>";

A staple beginning variation of the vertical pull is the Pulldown. The Pulldown involves flexion and extension of the elbow and shoulder, beginning with the arms overhead, drawing the elbows to the ribs until the hands are approximately level with the chin, then returning to overhead. The primary muscle groups involved include the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, posterior deltoids, and the biceps brachii.</p><p>The Level 1 Pulldown grip is a neutral grip, with the palms facing in. The handle should be set in the first crease of the fingers. As you level up, there will be other Pulldown grip options. Proper initiation of vertical pull movements involve scapular depression and retraction (drawn down and back). A common cue is to “create space between the ears and shoulders”. This ensures a “packed” shoulder position and latissimus activation. To complete the movement, draw the elbows down to the ribcage, without allowing the elbows to pass far past the midline of the body. This prevents the shoulder from rolling forward into an anterior glide, which irritates the anterior (front) structures of the shoulder and compensating upper back posture, increasing the risk of injury.</p>';
Description_Dict["UB Vert Pull"][2] = '<p>It is important to perform both bilateral and unilateral exercise variations. Unilateral exercises require greater stability and promote proper pillar bracing and resistance of rotational forces (anti-rotation). A unilateral variation of the pulldown is the 1 Arm ½ Kneeling Pulldown. The half kneeling pulldown is especially challenging due to its unilateral nature in both the upper body and lower body.</p><p>In a half kneeling setup, the front knee should be at 90°, with the back knee directly under the hip and shoulder. The handle should be in the opposite hand of whichever knee is forward (known as “contralateral loading”). The single arm position allows greater control of movement of the upper arm relative to the shoulder complex (known as “scapulohumoral rhythm”), however it can also be much easier for the elbow to track past the midline and create an anterior glide.

The seated position now allows for a chance to press from a more stable position, grooving scapulohumoral rhythm and lockout position. It is important to use the bench as a support, but not a “crutch”. Common issues with the seated overhead press include excessive arching/extension through the lumbar spine or slouching passively into the back of the bench.

The loaded carry involves literally every single muscle group in the body to at least some degree.</p><p>Set your grip correctly by placing the DB handle in the first crease of your fingers and squeezing hard the entire time. A strong grip improves force production of muscle groups through the entire arm and shoulder via the mechanism of muscle irradiation. Muscle irradiation is the phenomenon of creating greater tension/force production in a working muscle due to the innervation/activation of surrounding muscles. Strong glute and abdominal wall activation, which are cues for most exercises and especially carries, is also effective at producing irradiation. Carries force whole-body tension and activation as well as any exercise, creating a strong and rigid pillar (shoulders, spine, and pelvis).</p><p>Depress and retract your shoulder blades to keep a packed shoulder and stable back position, and attempt to keep a symmetrical posture at all times, without allowing the hips or shoulders to tilt in either direction. Focus on a \"heel to toe\ gait, in which a strong foot strike begins at the heel and finishes through the big toe, with the toes pointing forwards (neutral) and the feet directly under the hips.</p>";
Description_Dict["Carry"][2] = "<p>The suitcase carry involves a unilateral load, with only one dumbbell is used at a time. The suitcase carry can be considered an “anti-lateral flexion” exercise, as the lifter must resist being pulled to the side of the dumbbell and maintaining a neutral and symmetrical posture. An ideal suitcase carry looks exactly the same as a farmer carry, without the shoulders or hips dropping to one side. Be sure to select a weight where you will struggle, but can still maintain a symmetrical posture.</p>";

Description_Dict["Isolation"][1] = '<p>While Alloy Strength focuses primarily on the multi-joint, compound movement patterns the body can perform, there is absolutely a time and place for isolation exercises in any good training plan. While the biceps are easily the most overly trained muscle in the body, they play an important role in upper body movements and shoulder and elbow health. In a DB Biceps curl, the dumbbells begin at the side of the torso with the palms supinated (facing up). The lifter flexes the elbows, pulling the hands towards the shoulders, then lowering with control until the dumbbells are again resting under the shoulders. The major muscles involved include the biceps brachii, brachialis, and forearm flexors.</p><p>It is important to keep the scapula retracted and depressed, and to perform each repetition with control, in order to prevent extra contribution from the muscles of the upper back or any cheating “swinging” repetitions. The goal of isolation work is to activate a very specific muscle group. Be sure to select an appropriate weight that isn’t too heavy for the proper muscles to handle, otherwise larger and stronger muscles will take over.</p><p>There are three main functions of the biceps brachii: elbow flexion, forearm supination, and shoulder flexion/humoral depression. A common error when performing curls (especially when using weight that is too heavy) is for the elbows to instead track behind the midline of the body instead of moving forward and up. It is ideal for the elbows to rise slightly at the end range of motion of a biceps curl, which aids in anterior shoulder stability and health.</p>';

The triceps play an important role in the “lockout” of upper body push movements, and proper activation of the the triceps is vital for shoulder and elbow health. In a Cable Column Triceps Pressdown, the lifter flexes and extends the elbows, beginning with the cable attachment approximately chest height. The lifter extends the elbow, pressing the handle until the arms are fully outstretched below the waist, then rising with control until the hands are again in front of the chest.</p><p>The triceps is comprised of three distinct heads, each with individual tendons and origin/insertion points. The long head, in addition to extending the elbow with the short and medial heads, originates on the scapula, and so is involved in shoulder adduction and extension as well. Therefore, a small amount of shoulder flexion and extension when performing triceps pressdown is appropriate, but the vast majority of the movement should occur at the elbow.</p>";

Description_Dict["Iso 3"][1] = '<p>The face pull is one of the best accessory movements to aid in proper scapular mechanics and shoulder health. The movement is typically performed with a pronated (palms down) grip, with the thumbs pointed away from the body. The arms begin outstretched in front of the shoulders.

The major muscles involved include the posterior deltoid, middle trapezius, and rhomboids.</p><ul><li>Arm action: the major movements that the arms are performing in a face pull are initial abduction, or moving the away from the sagittal (front and back plane) midline of the body, followed by external rotation (rotating away from the midline).

Description_Dict["Iso 4"][1] = '<p>While Alloy Strength focuses primarily on the multi-joint, compound movement patterns the body can perform, there is absolutely a time and place for isolation exercises in any good training plan. One important function that isolation exercises can fulfill is not only addressing weak or lagging muscle groups, but to activate specific muscles in <i>planes of movement</i> that are often neglected.</p><p>There are three general planes of movement: the sagittal, or forward and backward plane, frontal, or side to side plane, and the transverse, or rotational plane. The vast majority of human movement occurs in the sagittal plane, and most of the exercises in the Levels Progression focus on improving strength in the sagittal plane. However, it is important to train all three planes of movement, and the Lateral Raise is an excellent way to improve shoulder strength and stability in the frontal plane. The lateral raise involves abduction (away from the midline) and adduction (towards the midline) of the shoulder. The lifter begins with the dumbbells at the sides, “pushes” the dumbbells away until the arm is parallel to the floor (90° at the shoulder), before lowering with control back to the sides of the body.</p><p>The major muscle group involved is the deltoid. The deltoid has three distinct heads: anterior (front), posterior (back) and medial (middle). The medial head is primarily responsible for shoulder abduction. Be sure to work to isolate this muscle by maintaining scapular depression (space between ear and shoulder) without shrugging and having the trapezius muscle take over the movement instead.</p>';
Description_Dict["Iso 4"][2] = '<p>In many of the techniques described in Alloy Strength’s Levels Progression, a large emphasis is placed on scapular depression, or driving the shoulder blades away from the ears. This is necessary for exercises performed with the shoulder below 90° of abduction, however when the arm is overhead scapular elevation is required for proper overhead flexion and scapulohumoral rhythm. Many people struggle with the correct overhead mechanics, and lack shoulder flexion or appropriate elevation due to a number of anatomical and lifestyle factors. Luckily, range of motion in flexion and elevation can easily be improved, and the Overhead Shrug is an excellent beginning exercise. The overhead shrug involves flexion of the shoulder, and elevation and depression of the scapula. The movement begins with the barbell pressed overhead. The lifter attempts to shrug the shoulders up to the ears, and pauses briefly before lowering to the starting position. The major muscle groups involved include the trapezius, serratus anterior, and deltoids.</p><p>For people who lack overhead flexion and struggle to bring the arm fully overhead (biceps by the ears) a common issue is losing a neutral spine and arching through the low back to attempt to bring the arm into the proper position. Draw your ribcage down and tuck your pelvis by activating the glutes to maintain a neutral posture and ensure that the movement is coming from the shoulder. If you are unable to maintain a neutral spine for this exercise, the <b>Alloy Strength Warm Up Series</b> can aid in improving overhead flexion, and you can also perform the exercise with a single arm only, using a kettlebell or dumbbell.</p>';
